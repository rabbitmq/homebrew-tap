# Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview

This is a personal Homebrew tap repository.

## Repository Structure

 * `Formula/`: Homebrew formula files

### Formula Code Style

 * Use `brew style` to format the formulas
 * Each formula file should include an MIT license header (the software packaged is dual-licensed under Apache-2.0 and MIT)

## Verifying Formulas

Use `brew style` and `brew audit` to lint and verify the formulas:

```shell
# Check style (linting)
brew style Formula/frm.rb

# Full audit (requires tapping first)
brew tap rabbitmq/homebrew-tap /path/to/homebrew-tap.git
brew audit rabbitmqadmin
# stricter checks for new formulas
brew audit --new rabbitmqadmin
```

## Comments

 * Only add very important comments, both in tests and in the implementation

## Git Instructions

 * Never add yourself to the list of commit co-authors
 * Never mention yourself in commit messages in any way (no "Generated by", no AI tool links, etc)

## Style Guide

 * Never add full stops to Markdown list items

## After Completing a Task

### Iterative Reviews

After completing a task, perform up to twenty iterative reviews of your changes.
In every iteration, look for meaningful improvements that were missed, for gaps in test coverage,
and for deviations from the instructions in this file.

If no meaningful improvements are found for three iterations in a row,
report it and stop iterating.
